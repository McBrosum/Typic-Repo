# Typic-Repo
This game was made by Peyton Robinson on 2/15/2025 using Godot and Affinity Designer 2. Full credits in-game.
 
 This game is a simple typing game that includes mistake sensitivity; when the player mis-inputs a character, it is more likely to appear later. There are also other features such as scene switching, a settings page, music, sound effects, animations, and player statistics.

 The game uses GDScript in Godot, a Python-like language with built-in UI features. Godot is a popular open-source game engine with 2D and 3D features.
 
 Typic was made to fill the gap of practicing keyboard memorization for all keys on a common keyboard. It was also made to gain indirect experience with Python and learn how to organize larger-sized projects compared to college courses.

 Thank you for reading!
